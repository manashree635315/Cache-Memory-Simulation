# IIT Roorkee CSE
# CSN-221
# Memory Project

### This project implements set-associative cache using write-back policy. 
### It is written in Verilog and implements a least recently used replacement policy.

## Specifications:
- number of ways is variable which is given as input
- number of sets is variable which is given as input
- 25 bit address

## Cases it can handle:
1. write-hit 
2. write-miss 
3. read-hit 
4. read-miss

## Instruction format:
- 1st bit specifies read(0)/write(1)
- rest 24 bits specify memory address

## Sample instructions:
- 0000000000000001110111110 (read)
- 1000000000001111110010001 (write)
